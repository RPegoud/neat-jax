        "However, there are also some differences to point out:\n",
        "In contrast to the CNN filter, the neighbourhoods in a GCN can be of different sizes, and there is no ordering of inputs. To see that, note that the CNN filter performs a weighted sum aggregation over the inputs with learnable weights, where each filter input has its own weight. In the GCN, the same weight is applied to all neighbours and the aggregation function is not learned. In other words, in a GCN, each neighbor contributes equally. This is why the CNN filter is not order-invariant, but the GCN filter is.\n",

        "2. _Message-passing / aggregate node features_: For each node, calculate a new feature vector $\\vec{h}'_n$ based on the messages (features) from the nodes in its neighborhood. In a directed graph, only nodes from incoming edges are counted as neighbors. The image below shows this aggregation step. There are multiple options for aggregation in a GCN, e.g. taking the mean, the sum, the min or max. (Later in this tutorial, we will also see how we can make the aggregation function dependent on the node features by adding an attention mechanism in the Graph Attention Network.)\n",

        "While the GCN we covered in the previous section can learn meaningful representations, it also has some shortcomings. Can you think of any?\n",
        "\n",
        "In the GCN layer, the messages from all its neighbours and the node itself are equally weighted. This may lead to loss of node-specific information. E.g., consider the case when a set of nodes shares the same set of neighbors, and start out with different node features. Then because of averaging, their resulting output features would be the same. Adding self-edges mitigates this issue by a small amount, but this problem is magnified with increasing number of GCN layers and number of edges connecting to a node.\n",

        "The graph attention (GAT) mechanism, as proposed by [Velickovic et al. ( 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903), allows the network to learn how to weigh / assign importance to the node features from the neighbourhood when computing the new node features. This is very similar to the idea of using attention in Transformers, which were introduced in [Vaswani et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762).\n",
